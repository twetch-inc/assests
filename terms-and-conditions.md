The Site is offered to you conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein (the “Terms”). Your use of Twetch.com constitutes your agreement to all such Terms. Please read these Terms carefully, and keep a copy of them for your reference.



Twetch.com is a Social Networking Online Discussion Site where registered members can be rewarded by other users for their contributions to the Site.



**Privacy**

Your use of Twetch.com is subject to Twetch's Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs the Site and informs users of our data collection practices.

Twetch does not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personal information from persons under the age of thirteen. If you are under 18, you may use Twetch.com only with permission of a parent or guardian.



**Twetch Communication Services, Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin SV Blockchain**

The Site contains software to help users post information onto the Bitcoin SV Blockchain (“BSV” or the “Blockchain”) and to also display such content from the Blockchain on the Site and may contain bulletin board services, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, personal web pages, calendars, and/or other message or communication facilities designed to enable you to communicate with the public at large or with a group, (collectively, “Communication Services”).

Twetch.com incorporates monetary incentives into the Site whereby you are able to receive compensation for your Submissions, including, but not limited to, when other users like, repost and/or licenses your content (“User Compensation”).   Twetch receives a percent of User Compensation earned.

Currently the Site uses moneybutton.com, relayx.io, and similar cryptocurrency wallet services as a way to facilitate the User Compensation.  In order to use Twetch, you must have a moneybutton.com, relayx.io, and similar cryptocurrency wallet services account.  Moneybutton.com, relayx.io, and similar cryptocurrency wallet services uses the cryptocurrency BITCOIN SV (“BSV”) for these transactions.

BSV, Moneybutton.com, RelayX, DotWallet, Handcash or any other BSV wallet used to sign in to Twetch are not owned, controlled, or operated by Twetch. Twetch has no control over the blockchain or the cryptocurrency and therefore we cannot ensure that your Submissions will be confirmed on BSV. The materials you provide to Twetch.com including your posts, uploads, inputs and submits to Twetch.com or our associated services (collectively “Submissions”) are stored on the BSV blockchain, a public ledger of information. Since we are only displaying posts that are posted to the BSV blockchain, we cannot delete or alter any information on the BSV blockchain after it has been submitted.  You acknowledge that by posting on Twetch you are posting on the BSV blockchain.  While we can remove your Submission from showing on Twetch.com we cannot alter or remove your post from the BSV blockchain.  Your post will live there forever for as long as related data hosting services hold said data.

We reserve the right to convert to a different blockchain and/or cryptocurrency protocol in the future.

**Twetch is Non-Custodial**

Twetch is non-custodial which means we do not store or have access to your Moneybutton, RelayX, DotWallet, Handcash, Twetch Wallet or similar cryptocurrency wallet services account or any of your accounts whereby cryptocurrencies or monies are transacted or stored. No monies flow through us or our Site. We do not hold or custody your private key recovery phrase, or any login credentials such as your login email, username, or password and we assume no responsibility for the management of your private keys tied to your Account.  We do not store, send, or receive BSV or other monies between users.  The only money we receive is the commission we earn on User Compensation which is paid to us by Moneybutton, RelayX, DotWallet, Handcash, Twetch Wallet and similar cryptocurrency wallet services in which the user has authorized to spend upon their behalf, specifically aknowledging neither Twetch nor Twetch Wallet service has access to your private key recovery phrase or funds at any time. Any transfer of title that might occur in cryptocurrency, including BSV, occurs on the Blockchain and not within Twetch. We do not guarantee that BSV blockchain or BSV can affect the transfer of title or rights in any cryptocurrency.

There are risks associated with using cryptocurrencies and blockchains, and you accept and acknowledge these risks.

In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or concerning these Terms, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties.
