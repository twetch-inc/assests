**Terms and Conditions**



**Agreement between User and Twetch.App / Twetch.com** **/ Twet.ch**

Welcome to Twetch.app and Twetch.com. The Twetch.app and Twet.ch and Twetch.com websites (the “Site” or “Twetch.com”) are comprised of various web pages operated by Twetch Inc (“Twetch”). The Site is offered to you conditioned on your acceptance without modification of the terms, conditions, and notices contained herein (the “Terms”). Your use of Twetch.com constitutes your agreement to all such Terms. Please read these Terms carefully, and keep a copy of them for your reference.



Twetch.com is a Social Networking Online Discussion Site where registered members can be rewarded by other users for their positive contributions to the Site.



**Privacy**

Your use of Twetch.com is subject to Twetch's Privacy Policy. Please review our Privacy Policy, which also governs the Site and informs users of our data collection practices.



**Children Under Thirteen**

Twetch does not knowingly collect, either online or offline, personal information from persons under the age of thirteen. If you are under 18, you may use Twetch.com only with permission of a parent or guardian.



**Twetch Communication Services, Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin SV Blockchain**

The Site contains software to help users post information onto the Bitcoin SV Blockchain (“BSV” or the “Blockchain”) and to also display such content from the Blockchain on the Site and may contain bulletin board services, chat areas, news groups, forums, communities, personal web pages, calendars, and/or other message or communication facilities designed to enable you to communicate with the public at large or with a group, (collectively, “Communication Services”).

Twetch.com incorporates monetary incentives into the Site whereby you are able to receive compensation for your Submissions, including, but not limited to, when other users like, repost and/or licenses your content (“User Compensation”).   Twetch receives a percent of User Compensation earned.

Currently the Site uses moneybutton.com, relayx.io, and similar cryptocurrency wallet services as a way to facilitate the User Compensation.  In order to use Twetch, you must have a moneybutton.com, relayx.io, and similar cryptocurrency wallet services account.  Moneybutton.com, relayx.io, and similar cryptocurrency wallet services uses the cryptocurrency BITCOIN SV (“BSV”) for these transactions.

BSV and Moneybutton.com are not owned, controlled, or operated by Twetch. Twetch has no control over the blockchain or the cryptocurrency and therefore we cannot ensure that your Submissions will be confirmed on BSV. The materials you provide to Twetch.com including your posts, uploads, inputs and submits to Twetch.com or our associated services (collectively “Submissions”) are stored on the BSV blockchain, a public ledger of information. Since we are only displaying posts from the BSV blockchain, we cannot delete or alter any information on the BSV blockchain.  You acknowledge that by posting on Twetch you are posting on the BSV blockchain.  While we can remove your Submission from showing on Twetch.com we cannot alter or remove your post from the BSV blockchain.  Your post will live there forever for as long as related data hosting services hold it.

We reserve the right to convert to a different blockchain and/or cryptocurrency protocol in the future.  We will notify you if this happens.

**Twetch is Non-Custodial**

Twetch is non-custodial which means we do not store or have access to your moneybutton.com, relayx.io, and similar cryptocurrency wallet services account or any of your accounts whereby cryptocurrencies or monies are transacted or stored. No monies flow through us or our Site.  We do not hold or custody your private key and we assume no responsibility for the management of your private keys tied to your Account.  We do not store, send, or receive BSV or other monies between users.  The only money we receive is the commission we earn on User Compensation which is paid to us by moneybutton.com, relayx.io, and similar cryptocurrency wallet services or by any future cryptocurrency protocol that we might use. Any transfer of title that might occur in cryptocurrency, including BSV, occurs on the Blockchain and not within Twetch. We do not guarantee that BSV blockchain or BSV can affect the transfer of title or rights in any cryptocurrency.

There are risks associated with using cryptocurrencies and blockchains, and you accept and acknowledge these risks.

**You Own Your Submissions**

Twetch does not claim ownership of your Submissions. However, by uploading your Submission you are granting Twetch a perpetual, nonexclusive, royalty-free license to show and publish it on Twetch.com, including anything reasonably related to publishing it (like, displaying, reformatting, and distributing it). We may also use your content to promote Twetch.com, including its products and content. We will never sell your content to third parties without your explicit permission.

Twetch is under no obligation to post or use any Submission you may provide and may block any Submission at any time from showing on the Site in Twetch's sole discretion and without explanation. All Twetch posts are final and non-refundable.



By uploading your Submission, you warrant and represent that you own or otherwise control all of the rights to your Submission as described in this section including, without limitation, all the rights necessary for you to provide, post, upload, input or submit the Submissions.

Twetch does not control or endorse the content, messages or information found in any Communication Service and, therefore, Twetch specifically disclaims any liability with regard to the Communication Services and any actions resulting from your participation in any Communication Service. Managers and hosts are not authorized Twetch spokespersons, and their views do not necessarily reflect those of Twetch.



Materials uploaded to a Communication Service may be subject to posted limitations on usage, reproduction and/or dissemination. You are responsible for adhering to such limitations if you upload the materials.



**Copyright Complaints, the DMCA, and Takedowns**

Again, we cannot delete the posts from the Bitcoin SV blockchain or any related data hosting services but we can and will not show such posts on the Site.

**Arbitration**

In the event the parties are not able to resolve any dispute between them arising out of or concerning these Terms, or any provisions hereof, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise at law or in equity for damages or any other relief, then such dispute shall be resolved only by final and binding arbitration pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, conducted by a single neutral arbitrator and administered by the American Arbitration Association, or a similar arbitration service selected by the parties, in a location mutually agreed upon by the parties. The arbitrator's award shall be final, and judgment may be entered upon it in any court having jurisdiction. In the event that any legal or equitable action, proceeding or arbitration arises out of or concerns these Terms, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and reasonable attorney's fees. The parties agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims in regards to these Terms or any disputes arising as a result of these Terms, whether directly or indirectly, including Tort claims that are a result of these Terms.

The entire dispute, including the scope and enforceability of this arbitration provision shall be determined by the Arbitrator.

**Class Action Waiver**

Any arbitration under these Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class/representative/collective actions are not permitted.
